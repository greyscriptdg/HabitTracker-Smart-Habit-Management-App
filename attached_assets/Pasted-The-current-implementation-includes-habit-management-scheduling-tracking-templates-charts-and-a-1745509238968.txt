The current implementation includes habit management, scheduling, tracking, templates, charts, and a stats dashboard. Now, I want to upgrade this app to a modern, professional-level frontend with animations, interactivity, and optionally AI-powered features.
Please help me implement or scaffold the following advanced frontend + UX features, organized by category:

🔥 UI/UX ENHANCEMENTS
Micro-interactions for buttons, habit toggles, and card transitions.
Staggered animations for cards and charts loading (Framer Motion or CSS).
Empty state illustrations or Lottie animations for no habits, all done, no data, etc.
Dark/Light mode auto-toggle based on system or time of day.
Customizable dashboard where users can rearrange or pin stat cards.
Themed icon packs per category (work, health, study, etc.).
🚀 MODERN FRONTEND ADDITIONS
Progressive Web App (PWA) support — installable on desktop and mobile with offline support.
Widget-style mini dashboards or quick log panels on homepage.
Timeline view of habits (horizontal scroll, Gantt-style).
Gamification elements like XP, badges, rewards, confetti on streaks.
Seasonal or popular habit suggestions on add habit screen.
🧠 AI-POWERED FEATURES (Optional GPT/LLM-based)
Weekly insights/reports like “You're most consistent on weekends” based on user data.
Smart habit templates generated from goals — e.g., user types “Improve focus” → get 3 habits.
Predictive reminders — adjust notification timings based on missed habits or streaks.
Natural language input logging — user types “I walked today” → marks habit complete.
📊 DATA & UTILITIES
Export/Import feature (CSV or JSON) to back up and restore habit history.
Multi-profile support to track different users or client profiles.
Shared/group habits — sync with family/friends (optional Firebase or socket support).
Webhooks/Zapier integration — connect to Google Sheets, Notion, Slack, etc.
🎨 DESIGN SYSTEM & POLISH
Create a reusable Design System: buttons, inputs, modals, stat cards, badges, etc.
Apply glassmorphism or neumorphism design styles for habit cards and dashboard.
Add Framer Motion / GSAP-based animations for transitions and chart interactions.
Improve accessibility — readable colors, focus states, screen reader support.
⚙️ CONTEXT
Use existing PostgreSQL schema and REST API endpoints already set up.
Prefer clean, reusable component structures (React/TypeScript/Next.js preferred if applicable).
Prioritize mobile-first, responsive UI with dark mode compatibility.
Feel free to use Chakra UI, Tailwind, or Material UI — but animations and interactivity are key.
All features must feel fast, elegant, and mobile-friendly.
